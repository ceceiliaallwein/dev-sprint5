# Exercise 12.4 - anagrams

'''

1
Write a program that reads a word list from a file (see Section 9.1) and prints all the sets of words that are anagrams.

Here is an example of what the output might look like:
['deltas', 'desalt', 'lasted', 'salted', 'slated', 'staled']
['retainers', 'ternaries']
['generating', 'greatening']
['resmelts', 'smelters', 'termless']

Hint: you might want to build a dictionary that maps from a set of letters to a list of words that can be spelled with those letters. The question is, how can you represent the set of letters in a way that can be used as a key?


2
Modify the previous program so that it prints the largest set of anagrams first, followed by the second largest set, and so on.


3 In Scrabble a “bingo” is when you play all seven tiles in your rack, along with a letter on the board, to form an eight-letter word. What set of 8 letters forms the most possible bingos? Hint: there are seven.
